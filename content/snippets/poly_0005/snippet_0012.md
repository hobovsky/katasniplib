Codewars uses ScalaTest and ScalaCheck for Scala tests. The libraries are very flexible and allow for many possibilities of organization of tests. Most of them is showcased in ["Scala reporter test" kumite](https://www.codewars.com/kumite/62db072919b85700345e2c8d).

_TODO: Add an example of one testing style to this snippet._

### More information:
