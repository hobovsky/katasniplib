```ruby
# From Ruby 3.0, RSpec is used under the hood.
# See https://rspec.info/
# Defaults to the global `describe` for backwards compatibility, but `RSpec.desribe` works as well.
RSpec.describe "Example tests" do
  
  it "Test case 1" do
     # ...
  end

  it "Test case 2" do
     # ...
  end
end
```
