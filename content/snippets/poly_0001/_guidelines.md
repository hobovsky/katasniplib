- Tests run against a presented solution stub should fail gracefully.
- A solution setup should present a 'to be done' placeholder idiomatic for its language, if there is such.
- Code comments with funny prompts are discouraged.
- If return type and types of arguments can be inferred by a compiler, it's still recommended to include them explicitly. Omitted  types can result in confusing compilation errors if a solver does not get them right.
