```python
test.assert_equals(actual, expected, f"Incorrect answer for input = {input}")
```

Custom message should contain only some additional information about a reason of a failure. Codewars Python Testing Framework provides basic information, such as `actual` and `expected` values, kind of a failed assertion, etc.
