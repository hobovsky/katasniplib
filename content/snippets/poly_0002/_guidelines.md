Snippets in this polyglot should present usage of assertions in a way which provides useful feedback with custom failure messages.

Assertion message should present input, actual, and expected values, if possible.

If necessary, a note in a snippet can explain how assertion functions modify default messages: replace them completely, or is the custom message appended to the default one, is there some additional formatting (line breaks, indentation) necessary, etc.

Formatted values should be ideally presented in a way which makes them easy to see (empty strings, leading/trailing/adjacent/all whitespace), and easy to copy from the failure message and paste into a user code: strings would be quoted and escaped if necessary, etc.
