Snippets in this polyglot should present most suitable ways of shuffling a collection in a given language. Languages vary in terms of available random utilities and possible techniques. Snippets in this polyglot can include one or more of following approaches:
- a standard library function,
- an external library function,
- example implementation of Fisher-Yates algorithm,
- example implementation of "sort by random key" algorithm, which might be arguably not the best approach in general for some languages, but should be good enough for Codewars kata.
